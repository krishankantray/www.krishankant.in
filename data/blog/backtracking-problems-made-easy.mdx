Backtracking problems seems to be one of the tricky part while studying DSA. But once we figure out a pattern in it, then its even easier than array problems.

A general code structure of a backtracking problem solution looks like :
```cpp
    void Backtrack(int start, vector<int>&arr, int &ans)
    {
        //Base case 
    
        for(int i=start; i<arr.size(); i++)
        {
            //include the current element at this position if possible in the ans 
            
            Backtrack(start+1) // here take care whethere to pass start or start+1 dending on the usecase
            
            //backtrack by removing current element 
        }
    }
```
To avoid duplicates in backtracking, we generally sort the array/list, then keep track of the duplicates by `arr[i] == arr[i-1]`.  

Here are some good backtracking problems which makes our understanding about the topic more firm :
