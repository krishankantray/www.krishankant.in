**Problem :** Mountain peak sequence  
  
Consider the first three natural numbers 1, 2, 3. These can be arranged
in the following ways: 2, 3, 1 and 1, 3, 2. Inboth of  
these arrangements, the numbers increase to a certain point and then
decrease. A sequence with this property is called a  
"mountain peak sequence".  
Given an integer N, write a program to find the remainder of mountain
peak arrangements that can be obtained by rearranging  
the numbers 1, 2, ...., N.  
  
**Input** 
  
One line containing the integer N  
  
**Output**
  
An integer m, giving the remainder of the number of mountain peak
arrangements that could be obtained from 1, 2, ...., N is  
divide by Mod  
  
**Constraints**:  
  
Mod = 109+7  
N ≤ 109  
  
**Example**  
  
Input  
3  
Output  
2  
Explanation  
There are two such arrangements: 1, 3, 2 and 2, 3, 1  
  
**Example**
  
Input  
4  
Output  
6  
Explanation  
The six arrangements are (1, 2, 4, 3), (1,3,4,2), (1,4,3,2), (2,3,4,1),
(2,4,3,1), (3,4,2,1)  
  
  
**Note: **  
  
Please do not use package and namespace in your code. For object
oriented languages your code should be written in one  
class.  
Note:  
Participants submitting solutions in C language should not use functions
from &lt;conio.h> / &lt;process.h> as these files do not  
exist in gcc  
Note:  
For C and C++, return type of main() function should be int.
